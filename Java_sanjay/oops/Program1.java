Class:
Java is an object-oriented programming language, and classes are used to represent real-world objects, concepts, or entities.
 Each class can have fields (attributes) and methods (behavior).

Example: If you're building an application to manage employees in a company, 
you would create an Employee class to encapsulate the properties and behavior of an employee.

  Constructor : when we create an object contructot is called ,It 's used to initialize an object'
  create with class name 


In Java, a constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
 It is called when an object of a class is created. 
The constructor has the same name as the class
 and does not have a return type
 can have multiple paramterrs or arguments
